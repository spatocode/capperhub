## TODOS
- Add ability to send plays through SMS, EMAIL and TELEGRAM. Consider the cost of integrating any service to the system. If the consideration doesn't work out, better allow an exclusive support of those platforms only by premium users.
- If websocket support would take lots of time to integrate, consider making a request on each refresh to few important APIs like subscribers and tips.
- Create a user to user betting system. A user can place a bet with another user on the outcome of an event. This would happen when a user send an SMS game request to a another user with details of the games involved. The user can accept by clicking the accept link sent with the SMS, to accept and register.




## Future Roadmap
- Evolve to develop a fintech product for recharging airtimes and data, making transfers(even using whatsapp, twitter or telagram API integration).
